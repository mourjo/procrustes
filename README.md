# Procrustes

This is a demo on load shedding in Clojure/Ring servers. It aims to show the difference between a server that sheds load and one that does not. The Makefile
contains the entry points to start the servers and a few client utilities to demonstrate the behaviour of these servers under load.

The load shedding strategy is basic, in the sense that it does not dynamically adapt to
changing conditions, the [Google SRE
blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/using-load-shedding-to-survive-a-success-disaster-cre-life-lessons)
calls this kind of load shedding a Procrustean load shedding.

> bring the load back to safe levels.

## Strategy for load shedding

This approach focuses on the following goals:
1. Bounded waiting time in the request queue
2. Unblocking client via timeouts
3. Limited number of open requests in the system

## Dependent services
This uses the following dependencies on ports (which can be installed via [this docker image](https://github.com/kamon-io/docker-grafana-graphite)):
1. Grafana on localhost:80
2. Statsd on localhost:8125

Additionally, the servers themselves start a JMX server for the client to dynamically
control how long a route should take (to emulate a downstream dependency becoming slow).

## Building the servers

To compile the code:
```shell
make compile
```

To start the load shedding server (hard coded to run at port 3100):
```shell
make load_shedding_server
```

To start the non load shedding server (hard coded to run at port 3200):
```shell
make non_load_shedding_server
```

To send a burst of requests to the servers:
```shell
make burst_request
```

To send a steady rate of requests and increasing the route processing time after a while:
```shell
make steady_requests
```

## Results

When the servers were sent a burst of requests:

When the servers were sent a steady stream of requests with a degraded dependency for a
while:
