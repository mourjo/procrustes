In its simplest form, load shedding can be a bit like that too: observe some easily obtained local measure like CPU load, memory utilization or request queue length, and when this load number crosses a predetermined “safe” level as established by load testing, drop a fraction of incoming traffic to bring the load back to safe levels.
